"""Level 1 — Rule-based heuristic scoring.

Based on feature importance analysis from Kim et al. (2018) and
empirical rules from Cas12a guide design literature.

Each sub-score is normalised to [0, 1] where 1 = optimal.
The composite score is a weighted sum.

Proximity-aware: for PROXIMITY candidates (PAM desert fallback),
the seed_position_score is replaced by a proximity_bonus that
rewards crRNAs closer to the mutation site. This is because
proximity candidates have no mutation inside the spacer — their
discrimination comes from allele-specific RPA primers, not from
crRNA mismatch position.

This is the baseline that works immediately without any training data.
