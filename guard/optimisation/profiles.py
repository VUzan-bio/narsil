"""Parameter profiles for sensitivity-specificity optimization.

Three presets cover the clinical deployment spectrum:

1. HIGH_SENSITIVITY (field screening)
   - Low thresholds: catch everything, accept false positives
   - For: resource-limited settings, initial screening, ruling out susceptibility
   - disc >= 2x, score >= 0.3, top_k = 5
   - Clinical rationale: In field screening at peripheral health centres,
     missing a resistant case (false negative) is more dangerous than a
     false positive, which can be resolved by confirmatory testing at a
     reference lab. Maximise mutation coverage.

2. BALANCED (WHO TPP)
   - WHO Target Product Profile for drug-resistant TB diagnostics
   - disc >= 3x, score >= 0.4, top_k = 3
   - Clinical rationale: Meets WHO 2024 TPP requirements — RIF sensitivity
     >= 95%, INH/FQ >= 90%, specificity >= 98%. The default for clinical
     diagnostic deployment in settings with confirmatory capacity.

3. HIGH_SPECIFICITY (confirmatory)
   - Strict thresholds: only high-confidence calls
   - disc >= 5x, score >= 0.6, top_k = 3
   - For: reference labs, confirmatory testing, clinical decision-making
   - Clinical rationale: When the result directly informs treatment decisions
     (e.g., switching from first-line to MDR-TB regimen), false positives
     carry high cost (unnecessary toxic drugs, prolonged treatment). Accept
     lower coverage in exchange for high discrimination confidence.

Each profile defines thresholds for:
    - efficiency_threshold: minimum predicted cleavage activity
    - discrimination_threshold: minimum MUT/WT ratio
    - offtarget_max_hits: maximum allowed off-target sites
    - cross_reactivity_max: maximum allowed cross-reactivity in multiplex
    - top_k: number of alternative candidates to retain per target
